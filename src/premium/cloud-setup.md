## Manual Setup

### 2. Create both public and private SSH Key


```shell
# This will auto generate the SSH Key if it not found it yet
osmedeus health cloud --debug

```

### 3. Create a snapshot with the build command

This will need [**packer v1.7.8**](https://www.packer.io/downloads) installed on your machine.

```shell
osmedeus provider build --rebuild

# or enable debug mode to see what's going on
osmedeus provider build --rebuild --debug
```

the result of the command should look like this
